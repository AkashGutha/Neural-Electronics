# Neural Electronics

An experiment ot recreate digital electroncis using Neural Networks.

The idea is to train the network on precomputed digital additions to train a digital adder network, and use the computed weights to model digital blocks woth analog circuits.

For the experminet i've used 4Bit and 8Bit adders.
